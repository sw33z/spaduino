/**
 \ingroup avr_stdlib
   \brief Convert an unsigned long integer to a string.

   The function ultoa() converts the unsigned long integer value from
   \c val into an
   ASCII representation that will be stored under \c s.  The caller
   is responsible for providing sufficient storage in \c s.

   \note The minimal size of the buffer \c s depends on the choice of
   radix. For example, if the radix is 2 (binary), you need to supply a buffer
   with a minimal length of 8 * sizeof (unsigned long int) + 1 characters,
   i.e. one character for each bit plus one for the string terminator. Using a
   larger radix will require a smaller minimal buffer size.

   \warning If the buffer is too small, you risk a buffer overflow.

   Conversion is done using the \c radix as base, which may be a
   number between 2 (binary conversion) and up to 36.  If \c radix
   is greater than 10, the next digit after \c '9' will be the letter
   \c 'a'.

   The ultoa() function returns the pointer passed as \c s.
